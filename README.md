Code Wars Practice Activities

https://www.codewars.com/users/NateA275

Work on a new branch for each challenge. For example, for today's challenge you can make a new branch with the command 'git checkout -b replace-all-dots'. When you finish the assignment each day, make a new pull request from your daily challenge branch to your master branch and submit the URL in Canvas.

Within your repo, you should create a separate folder for today's Code Wars challenge. As we progress throughout this course, you will be creating a new folder for each solution, so start off with an organized repo!
